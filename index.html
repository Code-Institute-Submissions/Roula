      <h5 class="card-title text-center">Something in return for data?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Now you maybe wondering why big data compnaies sell off your data to ad comapnies. Well its simple, they see your usgae on social media
      and see all the posts you may like a then simutianlousy target advertisments form your usage online. Big tech companies also go as far as accessing your microphones and GPS data and tagetting you that way as well.
      However sadly we have come to a point where there isnt much we can do about it because of how much we use technoloy in our modern socaity.
      <br>
      At Roula our main goal is to get the users discounts for the data they generate online; as well as reinventing the way we look at advertisments in general. Now some would think
      that if we just stop using social media and throw away our electronics we could avoid all this in general? Well thats not entrily true; now you could do that however you still will get advertisments based on purchases online or in store. There is little
      we can do to avoid it. Its time to get behind the idea of accpeting these advertisments but making it benifit the user, and not big technoloy companies! </p>

      and start scrolling and discoving ways they can save money. Instead on jumping into instagram every few mintues or pulling up facebook after closing the app a few seconds later. 
      In roula there will be plently of ways to save on purchases to make online; from using our seachbar to find discounts from your favorite local coffee shop. ANother example could be searching for your favotite
      podcast and seeing thier Roula profile and seeing what codes you could use to support your favorite podcasts while also saving you money!

      There are going to be many ways of earning coins; you just have to choose what todo with them.
        <br><br>The coins are also not just limmited to spending it within the store; they are also going to be able to be sent to other users with in the application. Say you eanred a good bit of coins one week and youd like to 
        send something nice to one of your friends; just send them some Roula Coins and let them pick from something in the store that might intrest them.

      <h5 class="card-title">Overall Coin System</h5>
      <p class="card-text">When talking about eariler about how Coin rewarding goes; we aren't just the only compnay to reward you for usage. However how many companies actually reward you for promoting the things you belive in, 
      like the small local coffee shop; or you local organic smoothie place. We are Roula want to enforce the importance of using our application for the better good of our local community and plan on reaching out to others who need it. <br><br>
      Now learning about how big technoloy companies take data and sell it off with out much knowledge to the users we plan on doing diffrent things here. Now obousily from from a business standpoint that data can't just disapear into thin air;
      they are ran from servers all around the world. The main diffrence is what comapnies do with that data. What we plan on doing with the data we generate from our servers is that we want to work in conjunction with advertisment comapnies and have them use the 
      peroasnalized data you use in the application. <br><br> Now keeping that in mind you can have an ease of mind with the data generated by you when serving the web and you just have random advertisments from other items your not intrested in. The 
      data you generate with us will be able to filter out all the unnnesary advertisments you see.</p>
