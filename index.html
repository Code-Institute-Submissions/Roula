      <h5 class="card-title text-center">Something in return for data?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Now you maybe wondering why big data compnaies sell off your data to ad comapnies. Well its simple, they see your usgae on social media
      and see all the posts you may like a then simutianlousy target advertisments form your usage online. Big tech companies also go as far as accessing your microphones and GPS data and tagetting you that way as well.
      However sadly we have come to a point where there isnt much we can do about it because of how much we use technoloy in our modern socaity.
      <br>
      At Roula our main goal is to get the users discounts for the data they generate online; as well as reinventing the way we look at advertisments in general. Now some would think
      that if we just stop using social media and throw away our electronics we could avoid all this in general? Well thats not entrily true; now you could do that however you still will get advertisments based on purchases online or in store. There is little
      we can do to avoid it. Its time to get behind the idea of accpeting these advertisments but making it benifit the user, and not big technoloy companies! </p>

      like the small local coffee shop; or you local organic smoothie place. We are Roula want to enforce the importance of using our application for the better good of our local community and plan on reaching out to others who need it. <br><br>
      Now learning about how big technoloy companies take data and sell it off with out much knowledge to the users we plan on doing diffrent things here. Now obousily from from a business standpoint that data can't just disapear into thin air;
      they are ran from servers all around the world. The main diffrence is what comapnies do with that data. What we plan on doing with the data we generate from our servers is that we want to work in conjunction with advertisment comapnies and have them use the 
      peroasnalized data you use in the application. <br><br> Now keeping that in mind you can have an ease of mind with the data generated by you when serving the web and you just have random advertisments from other items your not intrested in. The 
      data you generate with us will be able to filter out all the unnnesary advertisments you see.</p>

      Many small buissness from online to small mom and pop stores are having extremly hard times being able to keep up with thier bills. The lockdowns around the world are casuing people to stay home and shop online, to avoid the spread of the virus.
      The ones hurting the most are the ones that don't have a strong pressence online and rely heavily on local word of mouth to get more people into their store. <br><br> The model we want to build is to help out the ones that need the most help during these times.
      From helping them make advertisments; to reccomending users to stores they might find intresting.  However we won't be recommending users to webistes that are already built and established, we plan on rolling our own online store builder. This we be more the useful
      for small buissness owners to build thier own website with a ready to use store. <br><br> Now with all this being said why not earn and help others it doesnt seem tobe such a wild idea with all the crazy things we experinced this year! <br><br>Now lets go check out the store! </p>
