    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title text-center">Have you ever wondered where your online data disappears to?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Well, a massive amount of that data gets sold to advertisement companies, whether you like it or not. Sadly there isn't much you can do about it. <br><br>Until now, 
      Our Team at Roula is paving the way for a new way we look at data entirely!</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="card p-card bg-color-cd text-center">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title text-center">Something in return for data?</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Now you may be wondering why big data companies sell off your data to ad companies. Well, it's simple, they see your usage on social media and see all the
         posts you may like, then simultaneously target advertisements to you form your usage online. Big tech companies also go as far as accessing your microphones and GPS data
        and targeting you that way as well. However, sadly we have come to a point where there isn't much we can do about it because of how much we use technology in our modern society.
      <br>
      At Roula, our main goal is to get the users discounts for the data they generate online; as well as reinventing the way we look at advertisements in general. Now some would think that if we just stop using 
      social media and throw away our electronics we could avoid all this in general? Well, that's not entirely true; now you could do that however you still will get advertisements based on purchases online or in-store.
       There is little we can do to avoid it. It's time to get behind the idea of accepting these advertisements but making it benefit the user and not big technology companies!

      <h5 class="card-title text-center">How can we profit from this?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Well At Roula like we mentioned we are reinventing the online advertising sector. We want users who got nothing to do in their free time to jump into the app and start scrolling and discovering
       ways they can save money. Instead of jumping into Instagram every few minutes or pulling up Facebook after closing the app a few seconds later. <br> <br>
       
       In Roula there will be plenty of ways to save on purchases to make online;
        from using our search bar to find discounts from your favorite local coffee shop. Using our application gives you a direct way of helping small businesses in need. Another example could be searching for your favorite podcast
        and seeing their Roula profile and seeing what codes you could use to support your favorite podcasts while also saving you money at the same time. At the end of the day, a Roula account helps when people need it the most!  
      <br><br>
      Now Roula is not just going to be marketed to influencers and big businesses; in fact, we want to direct people to our soon to come advertisement creator. This part of the application will make it easy for users to create their special advertisements for their small business!
      We even will go as far as promoting your business to the "featured small business" where users will be able to interact and share to earn points on Roula for promoting small business!

      Earning points from promoting small business to using the special discounts promoted on Roula. The points you accumulate aren't worthless; we have a store where you can redeem it for great items. The points 
      can go towards account promotions where you will be given coin multipliers; so you earn even more points from the interactions you do through the application!</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Deeper Understanding</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> The coins are more than just a currency for our application. Think of A Roula Coin as a form of gratuity for the data you generate, through the application and outside of the application. 
      There are going to be many ways of earning coins; you just have to choose what to do with them.
        <br><br>The coins are also not just limited to spending within the store; they are also going to be able to be sent to other users within the application. Say you earned a good bit of coins one week and you'd like to 
        send something nice to one of your friends; just send them some Roula Coins and let them pick from something in the store that might interest them.

      like the small local coffee shop; or your local organic smoothie place. We are Roula want to enforce the importance of using our application for the better good of our local community and plan on reaching out to others who need it. <br><br>
      Now learning about how big technology companies take data and sell it off without much knowledge to the users we plan on doing different things here. Now obviously from a business standpoint, that data can't just disappear into thin air;
      they are running from servers all around the world. The main difference is what companies do with that data. What we plan on doing with the data we generate from our servers is that we want to work in conjunction with advertisement companies and have them use the 
      personalized data you use in the application. <br><br> Now keeping that in mind you can have ease of mind with the data generated by you when serving the web and you just have random advertisements from other items you are not interested in. The 
      data you generate with us will be able to filter out all the unnecessary advertisements you see.</p>

      Much of the small business online to small mom and pop stores are having extremely hard times being able to keep up with their bills. The lockdowns around the world are causing people to stay home and shop online, to avoid the spread of the virus.
      The ones hurting the most are the ones that don't have a strong presence online and rely heavily on local word of mouth to get more people into their store. <br><br> The model we want to build is to help out the ones that need the most help during these times.
      From helping them make advertisements; recommending users to stores they might find interesting.  However we won't be recommending users to websites that are already built and established, we plan on rolling our online store builder. This we are more useful
      for small business owners to build their website with a ready to use online store. <br><br>  Now with all this being said why not earn and help others, it doesn't seem tobe such a wild idea with all the crazy things we experienced this year! <br><br>Now lets go check out the store! </p>

        <dt>Phase 2</dt>

        <dt>Phase 3 </dt>
        <dd> This will be big because this will be when you will be able to trade in your coins for actual money, cryptocurrency included. Keep in mind this will be about 6-12 months after phase 2</dd><br>
